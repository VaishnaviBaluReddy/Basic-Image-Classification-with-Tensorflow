# Basic-Image-Classification-with-Tensorflow
This project aims to demonstrate the process of building a basic image identification system using the TensorFlow library and keras package.
<br><br>
In this repository, you will find the necessary code and resources to develop a neural network model capable of classifying grayscale images. The model will be trained on a dataset consisting of 60,000 examples, each with dimensions of 28 rows by 28 columns.<br>
By leveraging the power of TensorFlow, a popular and widely-used deep learning framework, we can implement efficient image recognition algorithms and train models capable of making accurate predictions.
##
**Key Features:**
<br><br>
**Dataset**: The repository includes a inbuilt dataset containing grayscale images, which serves as the foundation for training the image identification model. Some sample images are also provided.<br><br>
**Model Development**: Detailed code and instructions are provided to help you understand the process of building and training the neural network model using TensorFlow.<br><br>
**Model Evaluation**: You will find evaluation scripts to assess the performance of the trained model, including accuracy metrics and visualization tools to analyze the results.<br>
